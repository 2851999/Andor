* Added the method unbind() in Image

* Created the package org.andor.core.model

* Renamed Quad3DTest to Cube3DTest

* Fixed bug: VSync wasn't being used

* Hopefully decreased loading time and memory usage,
  ImageSet.loadImage() doesn't return an Image with
  anything inside, it only contains the texture
  coordinates and the size of the texture.
