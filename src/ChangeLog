* Updated to LWJGL 3

* Found Bug: Mouse behaves strangely when locked
  when using DSR (May just be 4K)

* Fixed bug: Android RenderableObject2D didn't rotate
  around the centre of the object
* Fixed bug: RenderableObject2D didn't render in the
  correct place unless the width was equal to the
  height on Android
* Fixed bug: Bitmap font's were not rendering in
  the correct place
* Fixed some GUI bugs on Android
* Fixed bug: Android normals were not set in the
  default shader
* Fixed bug: On Android updating a Renderer's normals
  wouldn't have worked properly
* Fixed bug: Animation2D didn't repeat an animation
  when 'repeat' was set to true
* Fixed bug: GUITextBox would move the cursor no
  matter what mouse button was pressed
* Fixed bug: Scaling a 3D object resulted in it's
  position being changed
* Fixed bug: Controllers didn't work properly with
  ControlBindings unless the controller was manually
  set
* Fixed bug: StackOverflowError when calling
  GUIDropDownMenu.getButtons()
* Fixed bug: Window didn't update the title
  property when updateSettings() was called
* Fixed bug: Running the engine on PC with with
  undecorated set to false, meant that using
  an orphographic projection had 0, 0 at the top
  left of the window instead of the viewable area
  
* NOTE: When using Andor to create shaders using
  GLSL, don't use the main method, instead use
  andor_main instead to increase portability to
  Android
* NOTE: Can now only use BitmapFonts, a default font
  will automatically be setup for GUI but on android
  this should be set manually
  (Settings.Engine.DefaultFont)
* NOTE: When using Android, you should put the
  resources folder into the assets folder
* NOTE: Linker errors are now also detected in
  shader programs
* NOTE: You can now load true type fonts from files
  and use installed fonts
* NOTE: Support for DSR (Dynamic Super Resolution)
