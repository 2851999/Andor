  will continue to improve this engine, even if this
  involve rewriting parts of it. This also includes
  optimisations that I will start making, when I am
  ready to, so that the engine will run much faster
  and be more intuitive to use. I have learn a lot to
  get this far, and hope I will continue to learn
  more.
