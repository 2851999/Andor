Andor
=====
<h3>Introduction</h3>

Andor is a game engine made for and in Java using LWJGL. It uses OpenGL
to provide 2D and 3D based graphics on both PC and Android.

Over the passed several months it has been in development and I have been
making it in order to learn more about graphics programming, specifically
OpenGL. It has now got to the point, where I have managed to achieve
everything I set out to do when I started it. This is why, I have decided
that I want to continue its development and therefore am releasing Andor
V1.

<h3>Features</h3>

Currently Andor has many features that have accumulated over time. These
features are not exactly cutting edge, but will nonetheless make game
development much more simple for those that wish to start programming by
making games, or provide the tools to make development that would be long
winded take much less time to allow more time to be spent on game
mechanics.

Here are some of the current features as of V1.

- PC and Android support (OpenGL and OpenGL ES respectively)
- Forward and deferred (on PC) rendering
- Controller support
- Basic model support
- Networking support
- GUI (Ability to read and write GUI's)
- Lighting (Forward rendering)

<h3>Future</h3>

From the list of features above, you can see that there is not that much.
This is something I would like to change. Since being able to get
deferred rendering I am hoping to start improving existing features and
add many new ones. Some of the things I am hoping to include in the near
future:

- Proper model support (Materials and textures)
- Height mapping
- Normal mapping
- Shadow mapping
- Reflections
- Fog
- Better lighting support
- Performance improvements
- Possible SDK

The list above is just some things I would like to learn about and
implement. Currently development has been quite slow due to school work
and preparing for exams.

Overall so far, I have learned a lot from making this game engine and
have been extremely happy with how far it has come as 5 years ago I knew
nothing about programming and have since spent a lot of my spare time
making things like this. Hopefully this will continue into the future.
