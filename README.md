Andor
=====
<h3>Description</h3>
Andor is a game engine, developed using Java and OpenGL thanks to LWJGL. Andor will be similar to MyEngine but will start off being based around more modern rendering methods, and 3D rendering, hopefully while optimising the performance. Eventually this engine should also be like MyEngine in the fact that it may be able to work on Android as well, but that may be a long time away.
